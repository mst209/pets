# Pets

## Problem

Class design
Create classes Cat, Dog, Chicken, CatFood, DogFood, HumanFood, Lemons
● a cat likes CatFood, Chicken, and Milk
● a dog likes DogFood, CatFood, Chicken, HumanFood
● a Cat can meow and a Dog can bark (print "meow" or "bark" to STDOUT)
● when an animal eats food it likes, it makes a noise three times
● when an animal eats food it dislikes, it makes a noise one time
You can implement this any way you like, with whatever api you think makes sense.
Include a driver file which requires the files, instantiates the classes, and invokes the
methods to demonstrate the functionality.
